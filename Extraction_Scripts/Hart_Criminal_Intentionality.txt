### RRR 3 - Intentionallity Attribution (Hart & Albarracin, 2011)


# Criminal Intentionality


# The data preparation for the RRR3 project is somewhat more complicated. Aggregates lab data for the three scales 
#   (Detailed Processing, Intention Attribution and Criminal Intentionality) is available in a sub-directory. However, in order
#   to access data on the individual items, we need to delve deeper. As no aggregated data file at our desired level exisits, we
#   have to extract and combine the individual SPSS-data files, which contain data for each individual lab.


# FInd all file-names in relevant subdirectory, including their path in the file-name
full_files <- list.files(here("Data/Original Data/RRR3"), full.names = TRUE)

# Find all file-names in relevant subdirectory, WITHOUT path in the file-name
files <- list.files(here("Data/Original Data/RRR3"), full.names = FALSE)

# Identify all SPSS files
sav_files <- files[grep("*.sav", files)]

# Extract PI-names from the SPSS-files
loc_names <- substring(sav_files, 1, (regexpr("_F", sav_files) - 1))

# identify all SPSS-files, including their paths
file_locations <- full_files[grep("*.sav", full_files)]

# The following for-loop uses the read_sav function from the <haven> library
#  additionally, it includes a "source" column, using the PI-names
#  The result is a number of dataframes, with names of their replication PIs
for(i in 1:length(sav_files)){
  do.call("<-", 
          list(loc_names[i], 
               read_spss(file_locations[i]) %>%
                 mutate(source = loc_names[i])
          )
  )
}

# The Eerland_MT consisted of too many variables, so we only include the ones, which can be found in the other files
Eerland_MT <- Eerland_MT[,names(Arnal)]

# combining the files into a single data frame
ml3_Hart <- rbind(Arnal, Berger, Birt_corrected, Eerland_MT, Eerland_InLab, Ferretti, Knepp, Kurby, Melcher, Michael, Poirier, Prenoveau)

# 
# for(i in loc_names){
#   print(paste0(i, " - Perfective N: ", nrow(ml3_Hart[which(ml3_Hart$source == i & ml3_Hart$Condition == 1),])))
#   print(paste0(i, " - Imperfective N: ", nrow(ml3_Hart[which(ml3_Hart$source == i & ml3_Hart$Condition == 2),])))
# }

# storing in an object with the more "typical" file name found in this document
ia_df <- ml3_Hart

# adding a "factor" column
ia_df <- as.data.frame(ia_df) %>%
  mutate(factor = Condition,
         group = ifelse(Condition == 1, 1, 0))

ia_df <- ia_df[,c("A1", "A2", "A3", "source", "group")] # keep only relevant items for this scale


write.csv(ia_df, here("Data/Extracted (Project) Data/Hart_Criminal_Intentionality.csv"), row.names = FALSE)


rm(list = ls())
