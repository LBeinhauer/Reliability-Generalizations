### RRR 5 - Close Relationships (Finkel et al, 2002)


# Loyalty Forgiveness




# Similarly to the data in RRR3, no single data file at the level required for our analysis exists. Instead, raw data is found
#  in a sub-directory, containing participant-level data for each replication site. Over the following lines, we will extract 
#  and combine the data from the different labs

# parts of the code stems from the replication authors.

convert <- function(x){as.numeric(as.character(x))} # function that converts a column of Qualtrix output to useable form in R

# identify all files in the specific subdirectory
csv <- list.files(here("Data/Original Data/RRR5/Data"), pattern="*.csv", 
                  full.names = FALSE) # names of all csv files in folder
# include the path in the file-names, so we can call them more easily
full.csv <- list.files(here("Data/Original Data/RRR5/Data"), pattern="*.csv", 
                       full.names = TRUE)
# extract the author's name from the data files
authors <- sapply(strsplit(csv,split='_',fixed=TRUE),function(x){x[1]}) # authors' names
k <- length(authors) # number of labs
data.all <- lapply(full.csv, read.csv, header=FALSE) # Compile data from all labs into a single list
names(data.all) <- authors # assign author name to each dataset in list

# preparatory vector
ms <- rep(0,k)
for(l in 1:k){
  data2 <- data.all[[l]]
  colnames(data2) <- apply(data2[1,],2,as.character) # label columns
  data2 <- data2[-(1:2),] # delete first two irrelevant rows
  Exclude <- convert(data2$Exclude) # exclusion criteria
  if(max(Exclude)==2) ms[l] <- 1 # flag lab with any subjects that are Exclude=2
}

                               mutate(source = authors[i]))                 #  replication site's data file
